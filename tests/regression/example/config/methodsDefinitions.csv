method,definition
a,Crown width in two directions 90o to one another; assumes ellipse shape
b,Leaves scanned for area
c,Multiplying Leaf  mass with SLA
d,at ground level from two angles
e,dbh; approx. 130 cm
f,Leaf dry mass /trunk volume approximated as a cone
g,ovendried weight over green volume
h,data taken from other datasets
i,at 1/10 of height of tree
j,discs of stem dried and measured
k,leaf length * leaf width * correlation factor
l,5 marked places of diameter measurement to be able to remeasure at later time
m,from dried samples soaked in water for 24hr
n,using Site-specific allometrics equations for leaf area per tree
o,sum of individual leaf areas
p,scaling up from branches to crown
q,core sample at DBH
r,Conifers : projected leaf area
r2,Conifers : all-sided leaf area
s,Adelaide Technique = visually count units then take sample of units and calc area and scale up
t,scaling from branch to canopy
u,at base of crown
v,volume displacement method
x,from circumference
w,average between row and inter-row diameter
y,LAI estimated from allometric relationships calibrated on the destructive data of this excel file (one relationship per date and per stand)
z,calculated by multiplying two crown diameters
a1,average across entire plant
a2,average for entire species
a3,average within treatment
a4,average from 3 composite samples per treatment
m0,dry mass - method non-specified
m1,dried at 60-70oC
m2,dried at 50oC
m3,wet mass * dry/wet ratio (stem disk specific)
m4,Root systems were washed with high-pressure water jets; clipped to remove extraneous small (<5 mm) roots
m5,dried at 80 - 110oC
m6,fresh mass?
m7,dried at room temperature for a month
1,sample of leaves from whole crown
2,crown mass * SLA and leaf blade mass:total leaf mass = total leaf area
3,2-26 typical leaves
4,50 leaves taken from main axis; 1st and 2nd order branches of tree
5,one representatative leaf per individual
li,Light (ISF or PAR) (%) Above canopy light
li2,percentage relative to 50mol/m2/d
li3,(%)PPFD
li4,values in proportion; light measured with three hemispherical photographs
i2,measured at 1/10 of height for individuals smaller than 30cm
br1,includes petioles biomass
c1,total leaf area (m2) is calculated by multiplying the number of leaves with the mean leaf area of a random leaf sample (20 leaves for taller individuals but smaller samples for small individuals)
