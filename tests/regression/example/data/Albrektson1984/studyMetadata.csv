Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, "The sample trees were selected as stems of mean basal area, by classes of basal area, to represent the diameter distribution of the stands."
Leaf area, "Not measured."
Stem cross sectional area,"DBH measured in the field."
Height,"No additional information provided."
Crown area,"Every 10th branch, from the base to the top of the live crown, was taken systematically for the branch sample. To avoid systematic errors, the first sample branch on every sample tree was randomized. Length of these branches was used to estimate crown width."
Biomass,"Fresh weight was determined by section in the field, and converted to dry mass based on a subsample (of foliage and wood)."
Growth environment,"Single-species Scots pine stands, no other information provided."
Other variables,"The basal area of sapwood was measured on discs from breast height. Sapwood was visually separated from heartwood after they had been treated with sulphanilic acid and sodium nitrite (Anon 1962). The width of the sapwood was calculated from the average of four measurements at right angles. The mean annual ring width in the sapwood was calculated as the width of sapwood, divided by the number of annual rings in the sapwood."
