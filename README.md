Daniel Falster, Remko Duursma, Rich FitzJohn, Diego Barneche

An R package for merging data from different studies in a transparent and reproducible fashion

For `dataMashR` developers:
* Manual pages are made with roxygen2. In Rstudio, make sure to set up automated roxygen compilation under `Build\Configure build tools...\Configure`.
* Do NOT edit the Rd files in /man manually. Ever.
